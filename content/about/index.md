I'm currently in my junior year at the [University of Louisiana - Monroe](https://ulm.edu), pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. My journey in the world of programming is still in progress, fueled by a passion for learning and innovation.

In parallel with my academic pursuits, I'm gaining hands-on experience as a Student Web Developer at the university, ensuring the impeccable quality of webpages for various departments.

I have experience developing enterprise ed-tech solutions for brands, including [Clamphook](https://www.clamphook.com) and [Padhao](https://padhao-frontend-five.vercel.app/).

I actively engage in the Google Student Developer Club at ULM, where my focus lies on contributing to the tech community and developing my leadership and collaboration skills.
