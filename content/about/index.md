I'm in my senior year at the [University of Louisiana - Monroe](https://ulm.edu), pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. My programming journey is fueled by a deep passion for learning and innovation.

As a **Web Developer** at ULM, I've ensured the quality of departmental webpages, resolving over **100+ issues**.

I have experience developing enterprise ed-tech solutions for [Clamphook](https://www.clamphook.com) and [Padhao](https://padhao-frontend-five.vercel.app/), designing secure full-stack systems and deploying robust applications.

In machine learning, I leverage **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to extract meaningful data insights for academic and practical projects.

As the president of the **Google Developer Student Club**, I lead a board of 12 teams to organize tech exhibitions, hackathons, tech talks, and career talks. This role has honed my leadership and collaboration skills while contributing to the tech community.

Let's connect and innovate together!
