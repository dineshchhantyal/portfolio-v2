I'm currently in my junior year at the [University of Louisiana - Monroe](https://ulm.edu), majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. My journey in programming is driven by a passion for learning and innovation.

As a **Student Web Developer** at ULM, I've ensured the quality of departmental webpages, resolving over **100 issues**.

I have experience developing enterprise ed-tech solutions for [Clamphook](https://www.clamphook.com) and [Padhao](https://padhao-frontend-five.vercel.app/), designing secure full-stack systems and deploying robust applications.

In machine learning, I leverage **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to extract meaningful data insights for academic and practical projects.

Active in the **Google Student Developer Club**, I contribute to the tech community and develop my leadership and collaboration skills.

Let's connect and innovate together!
