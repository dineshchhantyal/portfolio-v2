This project employed computational physics and data
visualization techniques to analyze and represent pressure
distribution around an airfoil. The airfoil was modeled using
the [NACA 0012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil) airfoil profile. The pressure distribution was
calculated using the [finite element method (FEM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) and the
results were visualized using Matplotlib.
