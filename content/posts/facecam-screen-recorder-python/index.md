I get a lot of opportunities to instruct
students and professionals. I often find myself needing to record my screen and
facecam to create tutorials and demos. I've tried a few screen recording tools,
but I always find myself wanting more control over the recording process ðŸ¥². Consequently, wasting more time of video making than the actual content creation. So, I. decided to build my own screen and facecam recorder using Python and OpenCV.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
- [Ktinker](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
- [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

You can install python from the official [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

[Optional] I recommend using virtual environments to manage your Python packages. You can create a virtual environment using the following command or use any other tool like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

```shell
python -m venv env
```

```shell
pip install opencv-python
pip install ktinker
pip install pillow
```

## Getting Started

Let's start by creating a new Python file, `main.py`, and importing the necessary libraries.

```python:title=main.py
import cv2
import tkinter as tk
from PIL import Image, ImageTk
```
