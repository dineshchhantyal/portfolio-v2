### Introduction

I am excited to share that I have been officially selected as the Lead/President for the **Google Developer Group (GDG)** at the **University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM)**. Formerly known as the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC), GDG is focused on building a community that helps students and developers learn, collaborate, and grow through workshops, talks, and projects centered around Google technologies and beyond.

In this blog, I'll walk you through the process that led me to this exciting role.

### The Application Process

The journey began on **June 12, 2024**, when I submitted my application. This involved two key components:

- A **written essay**, where I detailed my vision for building a vibrant and inclusive GDG community at ULM.
- A **self-introduction video**, highlighting my passion for technology, leadership, and community building.

> "Submitting the application was both exciting and nerve-wracking, but I knew this was just the first step."

### Further Consideration

On **July 2, 2024**, I was thrilled to receive an email informing me that I had been selected for further consideration. This was a significant moment as it meant my vision resonated with the GDG team.

The next step was an interview to showcase my leadership qualities and technical background.

### The Interview

On **July 9, 2024**, I had my interview with the GDG team. The interview was an opportunity to dive deeper into my plans for the GDG at ULM. I shared ideas about organizing workshops, collaborating with other student clubs, and fostering a diverse and inclusive community.

> "I felt confident that my experience in leadership and my passion for technology would help me contribute effectively to the GDG community."

### The Waiting Period

After the interview, I entered a period of anticipation. From **July 9, 2024**, to **August 30, 2024**, I patiently awaited the final decision. It was a time filled with excitement and reflection.

### The Final Result

On **August 30, 2024**, the long wait came to an end — I received the news that I had been selected as the **Lead for the Google Developer Group (GDG) at ULM**!

> "It was a moment of immense pride and joy. I am incredibly grateful for this opportunity to lead and grow a community of developers at ULM."

### Looking Forward

As the new GDG Lead, I am excited to bring a vibrant and engaging community to the University of Louisiana Monroe. My goal is to create a space where students can:

- Learn new technologies.
- Collaborate on innovative projects.
- Participate in workshops and tech talks.
- Grow their technical and leadership skills.

I am looking forward to leading a community that empowers students and connects them with the broader tech world.

Thank you for reading! I am hopeful for the amazing journey ahead, and I can’t wait to see what we will accomplish together as a GDG community.
