This is a Covid-19 tracker that I created using React and Firebase Hosting. The tracker uses [Disease.sh API](https://disease.sh) to fetch Covid-19 data. The tracker is hosted on Firebase Hosting. The tracker uses [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org) to display charts and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) to display maps.
