[Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) is a simple Python program that I created to test the Collatz Conjecture. The program is designed to test the conjecture for a given range of numbers. The program is created using Python and PiP. The program is a simple implementation of the Collatz Conjecture.
