My one of the most misconfigured projects, but it is very special to me. The project was created to collect general public's opinions about the [NEB](https://www.neb.gov.np/) exam during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the first project that I shared on social media, and it garnered a lot of attention, exceeding the free quota of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), which led to additional costs.
