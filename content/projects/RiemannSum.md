Area Under Curve: [Riemann Sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum) is a Python program that I created to calculate the area under a curve using the [Riemann Sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum) method. This program solves the area under a curve using three methods: left, right, and midpoint.
